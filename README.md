There are three modes to this application:
- Total Sum
- Even Steven
- Itemize

In all three modes the user has the option of tipping on the total or the total without the tip. Clicking on the Include Taxes switch will determine if the tip includes the taxes. The later option requires that the tip total be entered into the field. If the user will tip on the total including tax, then the tax amount is not required.

#### Total Sum 
Use this mode for when you are not looking to split the bill at all. You simply enter in the total amount of the bill, the total amount of taxes for the bill and then slide the tip slider to the desired percentage. Below the slider, the total amount of the tip and the total amount due is displayed. 

#### Even Steven 
This mode splits the bill into even portions regardless if you ordered the lobster or ordered the side salad. Slide the Numbe rin Party slider to the correct number, up to 12 people, enter in the total amount of the bill, the total amount of taxes for the bill and then slide the tip slider to the desired percentage. Below the slider, the total amount of the tip and the total amount due is displayed.
